                    <h2>Who was Socrates?</h2>
                    <p>Socrates (c. 470 – 399 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy,
                        and as being the first moral philosopher of the Western ethical tradition of thought.</p> <br />
                    <p>An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing
                        after his lifetime, particularly his students <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_blank">Plato</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon" target="_blank">Xenophon</a>. </p> <br />
                    <p>Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. </p><br />
                    <p>Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning Socrates during Socrates
                        ' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' Travel Journal provides important information about Socrates' youth.</p><br />

                        <h3>The defense of Socrates</h3>
                        <section>
                            <p>Socrates begins his legal defence by telling the jury that their minds were poisoned by his
                                enemies when they (the jury) were young and impressionable. He also says that his false reputation
                                as a sophistical philosopher comes from his enemies and that all of them are malicious, yet must
                                remain nameless — except for the playwright Aristophanes, who lampooned him (Socrates) as a
                                charlatan-philosopher in the comedy play The Clouds (423 BCE). About corrupting the rich, young men
                                of Athens, Socrates argues that deliberate corruption is an illogical action because it would hurt him,
                                as well. He says that the accusations of him being a corrupter of youth began at the time of his
                                obedience to the Oracle at Delphi, and tells how Chaerephon went to the Oracle, to ask her,
                                the Pythian prophetess, if there was a man wiser than Socrates. When Chaerephon reported to him
                                that the Oracle said there is no wiser man, Socrates interpreted that divine report as a riddle
                                — because he was aware of possessing no wisdom "great or small", and that lying is not in the nature
                                of the gods.</p>
                            <p>Socrates then sought to solve the divine paradox — how an ignorant man also could be the wisest
                                of all men — in effort to illuminate the meaning of the Oracles' categorical statement that he is
                                the wisest man in the land. After systematically interrogating the politicians, the poets, and the
                                craftsmen, Socrates determined that the politicians were not wise like he was. He says of himself,
                                in reference to a politician: "I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows
                                anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not."(21d).[12] Socrates says
                                that the poets did not understand their poetry; that the prophets and seers did not understand what
                                they said; and that the craftsmen while knowing many things, though they also had much knowledge on
                                things of which they had none. In that light, Socrates saw himself as a spokesman for the Oracle at
                                Delphi (22e). He asked himself if he would rather be an impostor, like the "wise people" he
                                interrogated, or if he would rather be himself, Socrates of Athens. Socrates tells the jury that
                                he would rather be himself than be anyone else. He says that in searching for a man wiser than
                                himself, he earned the reputation of a social gadfly to the city of Athens and a bad reputation
                                among her politically powerful personages.</p>
                            <p>Having addressed the social prejudices against him, Socrates addresses the first accusation —
                                the moral corruption of Athenian youth — by accusing his accuser, Meletus, of being indifferent
                                to the persons and things about which he professes to care. Whilst interrogating Meletus, Socrates
                                says that no one would intentionally corrupt another person — because the corrupter later stands to
                                be harmed in vengeance by the corrupted person. The matter of moral corruption is important for
                                two reasons: (i) the accusation is that Socrates corrupted the rich, young men of Athens by teaching
                                atheism; (ii) that if he is convicted of corruption, it will be because the playwright Aristophanes
                                already had corrupted the minds of his audience, when they were young, by lampooning Socrates as the
                                "Sophistical philosopher" in The Clouds, a comic play produced about twenty-four years earlier.
                            </p>
                            <p>Socrates then addresses the second accusation — asebeia (impiety) against the pantheon of Athens —
                                by which Meletus says that Socrates is an atheist. In cross-examination, Socrates leads Meletus
                                to contradict himself: that Socrates is an atheist who also believes in spiritual agencies and
                                demigods. Socrates tells the judges that Meletus has contradicted himself and then asks if Meletus
                                has designed a test of intelligence for identifying logical contradictions.
                            </p>
                            <p>Socrates proceeds to say that people who fear death are showing their ignorance, because death
                                might be a good thing, yet people fear it as if it is evil; even though they cannot know whether
                                it is good or evil. Socrates says that his wisdom is in being aware that he is ignorant on this,
                                and other topics. </p>
                            <p>Regarding a citizen's obedience to authority, Socrates says that a lawful authority, either human
                                or divine, should always be obeyed. In a conflict of obedience to such authorities, he thinks
                                that obeying divine authority supersedes obeying human authority: "Gentlemen, I am your grateful
                                and devoted servant, but I owe a greater obedience to the [Delphic] god than to you; and, as long
                                as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practising philosophy"(29d). As a
                                spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi, he is to spur the Athenians to greater awareness of ethics
                                and moral conduct and always shall question and argue. Therefore, the philosopher Socrates of
                                Athens asks his fellow citizens: "Are you not ashamed that you give your attention to acquiring
                                as much money as possible, and similarly with reputation and honour, and give no attention or
                                thought to truth and understanding, and the perfection of your soul?"(29e)</p>
                            <p>Granting no concession to his precarious legal situation, Socrates speaks emotionally
                                and provocatively to the court and says that the greatest good to occur upon Athens is his
                                moral concern for them as fellow citizens. He thinks that material wealth is a consequence of
                                goodness; that the god does not permit a better man to be harmed by a lesser man; and that he
                                is the social gadfly required by Athens: "All day long, I will never cease to settle here, there,
                                and everywhere — rousing, persuading, and reproving every one of you." In support of the moral mission
                                assigned him by the Oracle at Delphi, Socrates tells the court that his daimonion continually forbids
                                him to act unethically(implicitly validating Meletus' accusation that Socrates believes in novel
                                deities not of the Athenian pantheon).
                                Socrates says he never was a paid teacher; therefore, he is not responsible for the corruption of
                                any Athenian citizen. If he had corrupted anyone, he asks: why have they not come forward to bear
                                witnesses? If the corrupted Athenians are ignorant of having been corrupted, then why have their
                                families not spoken on their behalf? Socrates indicates, in point of fact, relatives of the Athenian
                                youth he supposedly corrupted are present in court, giving him moral support.
                                Socrates concludes his legal defence by reminding the judges that he shall not resort to emotive
                                tricks and arguments, shall not cry in public regret, and that his three sons will not appear in
                                court to pathetically sway the judges. Socrates says he is not afraid of death and shall not act
                                contrary to religious duty. He says he will rely solely upon sound argument and truth to present his
                                case at trial.

                        <h3>Socrates' sentencing plea</h3>
                        <section>
                            <p>The jurors of the trial voted the guilt of Socrates by a relatively narrow margin(36a).
                                In the Apology of Socrates, Plato cites no total numbers of votes condemning or acquitting
                                the philosopher of the accusations of moral corruption and impiety;[13][14] Socrates says that
                                he would have been acquitted if thirty more jurors had voted in his favour.[14] In such cases —
                                where the penalty of death might arise as a legal sanction for the accusations is presented —
                                Athenian law required that the prosecutor and the defendant each propose an administrative
                                penalty to punish the actions reported in the accusations.</p>
                            <p>Socrates antagonises the court by proposing, rather than a penalty, a reward — perpetual
                                maintenance at public expense. He notes that the vote of judgement against him was close.
                                In that vein, Socrates then engages in dark humour, suggesting that Meletus narrowly escaped
                                a great fine for not meeting the statutory requirement of receiving one-fifth of the votes of
                                the assembled judges in favour of his accusations against Socrates. In that way, Socrates
                                published the financial consequence for Meletus to consider as a plaintiff in a lawsuit —
                                because the Athenian legal system discouraged frivolous lawsuits by imposing a financially
                                onerous fine upon the plaintiff if the vote of the judges was less than one-fifth of the
                                number of judges required by the type of lawsuit.</p>
                            <p>As punishment for the two accusations formally presented against him at trial,
                                Socrates proposed to the court that he be treated as a benefactor to the city of
                                Athens; that he should be given free meals, in perpetuity, at the Prytaneum, the
                                public dining hall of Athens. Receiving such public largesse is an honour reserved for
                                Olympic athletes, prominent citizens, and benefactors of Athens, as a city and as a state.</p>
                            <p>Finally, after the court dismisses the proposed reward — free meals at the Prytaneum —
                                Socrates considers imprisonment and banishment, before settling upon a punishment fine of
                                100 drachmae. Despite his poverty, this was a minor punishment compared to the death penalty
                                proposed by the prosecutors, and encouraged by the judges of the trial. His supporters, Plato,
                                Crito, Critobulus, and Apollodorus offered even more money to pay as a fine – 3,000 drachmae
                                (thirty minae)[15]; nonetheless, to the judges of the trial of Socrates, a pecuniary fine was
                                insufficient punishment.</p>

                        <h3>Socrates' departing remarks</h3>
                        <section>
                            <p>In the Trial of Socrates, the judgement of the court was death for Socrates; most of the jurors
                                voted for the death penalty (Apology 38c), yet Plato provides no jury-vote numbers in the text
                                of the Apology of Socrates; but Diogenes Laërtius reports that 280 jurors voted for the death penalty
                                and 220 jurors voted for a pecuniary fine for Socrates (2.42).[16] Moreover, the politically
                                provocative language and irreverent tone of Socrates's self-defence speech angered the jurors and
                                invited their punishment of him.</p>
                            <p>Socrates responds to the death-penalty verdict by first addressing the jurors who voted for his death.
                                He says that instead of waiting a short time for him to die from old age, they will now have to accept
                                the harsh criticisms from his supporters. He prophesied that his death will cause the youngsters to
                                come forward and replace him as a social gadfly, spurring ethical conduct from the citizens of
                                Athens, in a manner more vexing than him(39d).</p>
                            <p>To the jurors who voted to acquit him, Socrates gives encouragement: his supernatural daimonion did not
                                interfere with his conduct of the legal defence, which he viewed as a sign that such a defence was
                                the correct action. In that way, the daimonion communicated to Socrates that death might be a good
                                thing; either death is annihilation (release from earthly worry) and not to be feared, or death is
                                migration to a higher plane of existence in which reside the souls of personages and heroes, such as
                                Hesiod and Homer and Odysseus.</p>
                            <p>Socrates concludes his self-defence by saying to the court that he bears no ill-will, neither towards
