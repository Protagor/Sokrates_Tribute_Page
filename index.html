                    <h2>Who was Socrates?</h2>
                    <p>Socrates (c. 470 – 399 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy,
                        and as being the first moral philosopher of the Western ethical tradition of thought.</p> <br />
                    <p>An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing
                        after his lifetime, particularly his students <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_blank">Plato</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon" target="_blank">Xenophon</a>. </p> <br />
                    <p>Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. </p><br />
                    <p>Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning Socrates during Socrates
                        ' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' Travel Journal provides important information about Socrates' youth.</p><br />

                        <h3>The defense of Socrates</h3>
                        <section>
                            Socrates begins his legal defence by telling the jury that their minds were poisoned by his
                            enemies when they (the jury) were young and impressionable. He also says that his false reputation
                            as a sophistical philosopher comes from his enemies and that all of them are malicious, yet must
                            remain nameless — except for the playwright Aristophanes, who lampooned him (Socrates) as a
                            charlatan-philosopher in the comedy play The Clouds (423 BCE). About corrupting the rich, young men
                            of Athens, Socrates argues that deliberate corruption is an illogical action because it would hurt him,
                            as well. He says that the accusations of him being a corrupter of youth began at the time of his
                            obedience to the Oracle at Delphi, and tells how Chaerephon went to the Oracle, to ask her,
                            the Pythian prophetess, if there was a man wiser than Socrates. When Chaerephon reported to him
                            that the Oracle said there is no wiser man, Socrates interpreted that divine report as a riddle
                            — because he was aware of possessing no wisdom "great or small", and that lying is not in the nature
                            of the gods.
