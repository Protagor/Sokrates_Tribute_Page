                    <h2>Who was Socrates?</h2>
                    <p>Socrates (c. 470 – 399 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy,
                        and as being the first moral philosopher of the Western ethical tradition of thought.</p> <br />
                    <p>An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing
                        after his lifetime, particularly his students <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato" target="_blank">Plato</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon" target="_blank">Xenophon</a>. </p> <br />
                    <p>Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. </p><br />
                    <p>Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning Socrates during Socrates
                        ' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' Travel Journal provides important information about Socrates' youth.</p><br />
